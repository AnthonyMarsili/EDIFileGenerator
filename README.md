EDIFileGenerator
----------------

This repository holds a program that is used to generate Electronic Data Interchange (EDI) documents.

The user is presented with an intuitive interface that allows them to choose which type of EDI document they would like to create, which company they would like to create it for, and what data they want to be included in the file. The user can then easily copy the contents of the file and import it into their EDI system.

This was created in order to simplify the testing process for EDI systems. The user can now create documents according to the specifications that they need to test for.

The names of the companies used in this program, along with some of the company-specific information, was hidden due to privacy concerns.
